    <h3>Countdown to Summer by Ethan May</h3><p id="demo" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;top:0px"></p>
    Summer Vacation is almost here! We can almost taste it as we work hard to get the grades we deserve. Over a stressful
    year of learning and developing skills, students are excited to catch a break, let loose and have some fun! Summer
    vacation is the perfect time to go on trips in planes, trains, boats and more! But that doesn't mean the learning
    stops! Summer camps built for learning are also exciting! Outdoor camps or even religious camps can be loads of fun
    during the summer. Even though the sun feels good on your skin, don't forget to wear sunblock so the fun doesn't spoil
    later with sunburnt skin!
